These scripts may be used to collect basic performance measurements at regular intervals.  Each script supports a -i parameter which is used to specify the collection interval in seconds. The collection is synchronized to a modulus of the collection interval.  For example, if -i 15 is specified, intervals will be aligned to 0 15, 30, 45 seconds.  This allows output from multiple scripts to be correlated.
All scripts also support a stopfile (-s) parameter.  The scripts creates the file when it starts and continues running until the file is removed.  The script may also be killed, but removing the stopfile is the recommended method of termination.
